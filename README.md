# The Odin Project Recipe Project

In this project I'm going to be making a pure-HTML site for food recipes. Later, when I learn CSS *-Cascading Style Sheets-* I'll be revisiting it to add some style.

Once completed, I'll have demonstrated the following skills:
- Understanding of HTML tags, and its usage
- Understanding of lists, both ordered and unordered
- Understanding of links
- Hopefully, understanding of images and links
- Basic practice of git and its three scenarios
